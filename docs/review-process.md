# Two-Stage Review Process

Every PR passes two review stages: **stage 1 — AI review** (automated, advisory) and **stage 2 — human review** (self-review against a checklist). The design follows evidence-based review practice: small diffs (~<400 changed lines; defect detection collapses above ~400 LOC per sitting), AI delegated mechanical findings while humans keep intent/architecture judgment, and AI findings are advisory so they can never silently gate a merge.

## Stage 1 — AI review (automated)

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml` — **OpenCodeReview** (`alibaba/open-code-review`, pinned `v1.12.9`), Alibaba's review-specialized agent: deterministic file selection/bundling + a review agent with tool use, posting inline comments with line precision plus one sticky summary comment. Model — `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` on OpenCode Zen (OpenAI Responses endpoint `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/responses`, `OPENCODE_ZEN_API_KEY` secret, `llm_protocol: openai-responses`).

- **Manual trigger: comment `/review` on the PR.** Nothing runs on push — you decide when the AI looks. A comment that *contains* `/review` (e.g. "/review focus on SyncController") starts a run; bot comments are ignored; a running review is cancelled and restarted if you comment again.
- **Why this engine:** its published benchmark (AACR-Bench, 200 real PRs) shows the same-model quality of a general-purpose agent at **~1/9 of the tokens** and faster wall-clock — precision-favored by design (lower recall, near-zero noise). That trade fits this process: stage 1 is a cheap pre-clean, stage 2 (human + OpenSpec reasoning) catches the gaps.
- **Advisory by design:** the job never blocks merge — findings are review comments only. The human decides what to fix and what to waive.
- **What it checks:** repo-specific rules from `.opencodereview/rule.json` (committed, per-path): LocalStore chokepoint, OpenAPI contract sync, Theme colors / L10n en+ru / XcodeGen, Keychain-only tokens, test validity, CI hygiene — plus OCR's built-in language rules for Go/Swift/YAML. Note: unlike the opencode-agent stage 1 it replaces, OCR reviews diffs per file with targeted rules, not the whole OpenSpec change — OpenSpec compliance stays a stage-2 responsibility (PR template + `openspec.yml` gate).
- **What it skips:** style/formatting (golangci-lint + swiftlint already gate it); `openspec/changes/archive/**` and `.pbxproj` are excluded in `rule.json`.
- **Behavior across runs:** each `/review` reviews the PR diff; the first run covers `merge-base..head` in full and records a **checkpoint**; a later `/review` (after more commits) covers only `<checkpoint>..<head>` (fail-closed: any doubt → full review). The sticky summary comment is updated in place; low-severity findings are routed to the summary instead of inline (`route_severity_below: low`). Rapid re-comments: the concurrency group cancels the in-flight run and restarts.
- **Tuning:** rules live in `.opencodereview/rule.json` (path-scoped `rule` strings + `exclude` globs); knobs are action inputs (`review_concurrency`, `effort` low/medium/high, `max_tokens_budget`, `route_categories`); model/endpoint are `llm_model` / `llm_url` (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works).
- **Anti-rubber-stamping rule:** a quiet AI review is *not* validation. Stage 2 runs regardless of how clean stage 1 looks.

## Stage 2 — Human review (you)

Runs after stage 1 findings are addressed or consciously waived. Use the checklist in the PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md`) — it encodes the S5 iteration rules and the repo non-negotiables. Principles behind it:

1. **Review as a reader, not the author** — read the whole diff top-to-bottom once with fresh eyes before approving; self-review catches most issues before any reviewer.
2. **Humans keep what AI is weak at:** intent/spec fit, architecture fit (LocalStore chokepoint, OpenAPI contract), concurrency, product behavior. **Verify UI changes by running the app**, not by reading code.
3. **Tests must be valid, not just present** — would they fail if the code broke? Watch for deleted/skipped tests, especially in AI-written chunks.
4. **Optimize for the reader in 6 months:** names communicate, comments explain *why* not *what*; `git log` + PR description are the historical record (what + why + linked OpenSpec change).
5. **Code health over perfection:** approve when the change definitely improves the codebase; mark non-blocking remarks as nits and defer or do them explicitly.
6. **Size discipline:** ≤ ~400 changed lines per PR; split refactors from features; tests ride with the code they test.

## Flow

```
implement on branch
  → open PR as DRAFT
  → comment /review (stage 1): AI posts inline findings + sticky summary
  → fix 🔴 findings, push, /review again if needed
  → mark ready
  → stage 2: self-review with the PR-template checklist,
    verify behavior by running the app where it matters
  → all CI checks green (backend/ios/openspec) → merge
  → update OpenSpec tasks.md / advance the change as part of the merge commit's context
```

Draft PRs are the sequencing mechanism; `/review` is the switch — AI sweeps the diff when you ask, so pushes mid-development stay un-reviewed.

## Supporting checks

- **`openspec.yml`** — spec-integrity gate: `openspec validate --all --strict` (CLI pinned `@1.8.0`) on every PR and push to `main`. Fails broken OpenSpec structure; protects the spec-driven contract.
- **PR template** — OpenSpec linkage + S5 + non-negotiables + stage-2 checklist checkboxes.
- **Existing mandatory checks** — `backend.yml` (gofmt/vet/golangci-lint/race tests/coverage floor 45%/OpenAPI contract gate) and `ios.yml` (xcodegen/swiftlint --strict/warnings-as-errors build/tests). See `docs/ci.md`.

## Metrics (lightweight, optional)

- **AI-finding acceptance rate** — share of inline findings actually fixed (grep PR review threads); the core quality signal for tuning `.opencodereview/rule.json`.
- **Noise trend** — inline comments per review; if it grows, tighten rules or set `effort: low`.
- **Defect escape** — post-merge bugs the diff introduced; note them in the OpenSpec change when archived; quarterly skim of `openspec/changes/archive/` gives the rate with no tooling.

## Cost

OCR is the low-cost engine: deterministic file bundling means each review is a few single-shot LLM rounds per file group, not a long agent loop. On `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` (free contributor tier on Zen — prompts/completions usable for training future Meta models) a typical diff costs **nothing** per run; checkpoint mode keeps follow-up pushes proportionally small. Hard caps available via `max_tokens_budget` (0 = unlimited today). The concurrency group cancels superseded runs on rapid pushes.
