## User registration and sign-in

1. User opens the app and sees the welcome screen showing the app name, tagline, **Sign in with Apple** button, and **Continue with Email** button.
2. If the user taps **Continue with Email**, they navigate to the email entry screen.
3. User types their email address into the email field.
4. User submits the email by tapping the **Continue** button or pressing the keyboard Return key.
   1. If the email is not valid, the user gets a validation error with an error message beneath the field.
   2. Otherwise, the app requests a one-time code and navigates to the OTP page.
5. On the OTP page, the user enters the 6-digit code in the box field.
   1. The app auto-submits the code when the 6th digit is entered (after a short debounce).
   2. If the code is not valid or the server rejects it, the user gets a validation or server error, and the code field is cleared so they can re-enter it.
   3. If the user realises the email is incorrect, they navigate back to the email screen, which is pre-filled with the email they entered.
   4. If the user cannot receive the code, they can resend it after waiting for 30 seconds.
      1. After waiting for 30 seconds, the **Resend code** button becomes enabled.
      2. When the code is resent, the user gets an appropriate feedback message.
   5. If the code is valid and accepted by the server, the user is signed in and the app shows the main time-tracking screen.
6. If the user chooses **Sign in with Apple** on the welcome screen, the native Apple authorization sheet appears. On success, the user is signed in and the app shows the main time-tracking screen.
