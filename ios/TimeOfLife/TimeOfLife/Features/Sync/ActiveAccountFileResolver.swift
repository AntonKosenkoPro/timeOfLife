/// Resolves the ACTIVE account's database file for cross-process surfaces —
/// lock-screen Control intents, widgets, and any future extension (lock-
/// screen-controls delta, account-bound-local-data 4.2). These surfaces hold
/// no session of their own: device unlock is the authorization, and the
/// shared-session user id (the same `SessionCache` UserDefaults the app
/// persists on sign-in) selects which `lifio_<userId>.db` is active.
///
/// The user id is read FILE-FIRST (`active-session-user-id` in the
/// container, mirrored by `SessionCache` on every sign-in/out): suite
/// `UserDefaults` reads detach from `cfprefsd` inside some extension
/// processes (observed on-device: intent silently resolved `.locked`
/// for a real session), while group-container file reads stay reliable —
/// the same channel `LocalStore` itself depends on cross-process.
/// Suite defaults remain as the fallback.
///
/// Resolution rules (lock-screen-controls delta spec):
/// - No shared-session user id (signed out at the auth gate) → `.locked`:
///   the control shows a locked/empty state and never reads or creates an
///   anonymous file.
/// - A user id exists but its file is missing on disk (erased account, or
///   the device holds only dormant files for other accounts) → `.noData`:
///   the control shows an empty state without creating the file.
/// - A readable file → `.ready` with its URL; the caller opens it read-only
///   (or via the app's store when in-process) — never a dormant account's
///   file, because only the shared-session user id is ever resolved.
///
/// Never opens, migrates, or writes a database — extension surfaces must not
/// create files as a side effect of rendering (`LocalStore` remains the
/// single mutation chokepoint).
