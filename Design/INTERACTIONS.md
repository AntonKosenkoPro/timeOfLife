# Interaction Patterns

These rules apply across all screens unless a screen spec explicitly overrides them.

## Loading states

- Buttons show an indeterminate `ProgressView` inside the button at full width.
- Do **not** show blocking full-screen loaders for primary actions.
- Disable submit and destructive actions while `isLoading == true`.
- Keep the rest of the UI interactive (e.g., the user can tap back or dismiss).

## Errors

- Field errors appear **directly beneath** the related input field.
- Use a single unified message per field (Requirements U4). Example: "Email must be a valid email address and be at most 254 characters."
- Non-field errors (server, offline) appear as a banner above the primary action.
- Clear field errors when the user edits the corresponding field.
- Map server error codes to localized strings via `ErrorLocalization.message(for:)`.

## Offline

- Show `OfflineBanner` at the top of every screen when `connectivity.isConnected == false`.
- Render the banner below the navigation bar / top safe area using `.safeAreaInset(edge: .top)` so it does not overlap back buttons or navigation controls.
- Disable network-dependent submit buttons while offline.
- Cache the authenticated session; restore it on app launch.
- Logout must work offline by clearing the local session.

## Empty / placeholder states

- Use `EmptyState` with an SF Symbol, a headline, and a subheadline.
- Center it in the available space.
- No custom illustrations for the MVP.

## Focus management

- Focus the primary input field when a screen appears.
- Move focus to the next field with `.submitLabel(.continue)` and `.onSubmit`.
- Dismiss the keyboard when the primary action is triggered.

## Keyboard and primary input placement

When a screen’s main purpose is to collect input from a single field (email, OTP, activity name, etc.), the layout must guarantee that the focused field and the primary action button remain visible while the system keyboard is open.

### Placement rules

1. **Primary input stays above the keyboard without scrolling.**
   - Position the input field in the upper half of the screen (top-aligned content), not vertically centered.
   - On appear, focus the field immediately. The user should already see the caret and typed characters without the app needing to scroll.
2. **Primary action follows the keyboard.**
   - Place the submit / continue / primary button in a pinned bottom action bar using `.safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom)`.
   - The action bar animates with the keyboard on iOS 15+ and stays tappable above the keyboard.
3. **Reserve space for the action bar in the scrollable content.**
   - Add a bottom spacer (measured via `BottomBarHeightPreferenceKey` or fixed) equal to the action bar height plus `Theme.spacingLarge` so the scrollable content ends well above the bar.
   - This prevents the input from being obscured on short screens (e.g., iPhone SE 1st gen) when the keyboard is open.
4. **Use a `ScrollView` as a safety net.**
   - Even though the input is positioned to avoid the keyboard, wrap the form in a `ScrollView` so the user can correct any overlap caused by larger dynamic-type sizes or smaller devices.
5. **Do not rely on `Spacer()` to center the form.**
   - Centering pushes the field into the keyboard zone on short devices. Use a small top padding and fixed spacers instead.

### Anti-patterns

- Centering the form with `Spacer()` above and below the input.
- Placing the primary action button inside the scrollable content where it can be scrolled behind the keyboard.
- Forcing the user to scroll manually to see what they are typing.

## Auth flow interactions

### Return-key submit

- Email fields use `.submitLabel(.continue)` and `.onSubmit` to submit via the keyboard Return key.
- A visible primary button that performs the same action must also exist. VoiceOver / Switch Control users may never discover the Return-key shortcut.

### OTP input and auto-submit

- The OTP field is a single hidden `TextField` with `.textContentType(.oneTimeCode)`. Visual digit boxes are decorative and hidden from VoiceOver.
- The hidden field stays first responder while the OTP screen is visible so SMS AutoFill / QuickType can insert the code.
- Tapping any digit box focuses the hidden field.
- Typing, pasting, or AutoFill updates the bound code.
- Auto-submit triggers only after the code reaches the required length (6 digits), debounced by 250 ms so the user sees the complete code before the network call.
- On a verification error, clear the code and re-focus the hidden field so the user can re-type immediately. Do not force focus when VoiceOver is running.
- Do not auto-submit partial codes or on every keystroke.

### Sign Out

- Sign Out is a destructive, low-frequency account action owned by Profile.
- The Track toolbar does not expose account actions as a peer to capture.
- Tapping Sign Out must show a confirmation alert before clearing the local session, because local timer data may be lost.
- Sign Out must work offline by clearing the local session.

### Profile destination

- The person control opens Profile for all users — signed out and signed in.
- Signed out, the account section offers **Enable Sync**; local entry/category management, integrations, export, appearance, and data controls remain accessible independently.
- Signed in, the account section shows sync status ("Last synced"/"Syncing…"/error) and a manual "Sync now" action, plus sign-out.
- "Erase local data" is a destructive, confirmed action that wipes the local database (state + outbox + undo buffer + sync cursors).

### Auth transitions

- Auth screens (Welcome → Email → OTP) are pushed on the shared `AppNavigationStack`.
- Use the system `NavigationStack` push slide. Do not add custom `.transition()` modifiers that could break the iOS 15 `NavigationView(.stack)` polyfill.
- iOS 18 native zoom navigation transitions are noted as future-only and require a separate decision.

## Haptics

| Action | Haptic |
|---|---|
| Start timer | `.selection` |
| Stop / save timer | `.success` |
| Validation error | `.notification(.error)` |
| Sign in success | `.success` |

Keep haptics subtle. Do not vibrate on every keystroke.

## Navigation

- Use `AppNavigationStack` for programmatic push/pop.
- iOS 16+ uses `NavigationStack` + `navigationDestination(for:)`.
- iOS 15 uses `NavigationView(.stack)` with a hidden `NavigationLink` bound to `path.last`.
- Do not use `NavigationLink` directly for programmatic navigation.

## App shell (Track / History / Insights / Profile)

D1 (OpenSpec change `redesign-track-experience`). The root is a three-tab shell, not a timer-only root:

- **Track, History, Insights are the primary destinations.** Track is initially selected and is the only destination that starts or stops a timer.
- **Profile is a sheet, not a tab.** A consistent top-trailing person control on every tab opens it. Profile owns account/sync, category management, integrations, export, appearance, and destructive data controls.
- **Switching destinations never changes timer state** and never discards the previous destination's state.
- **The app launches into Track without authentication**; History and Insights are reachable unsigned. Auth is an optional "Enable Sync" action inside Profile.
- **A running timer stays globally accessible.** While running, History and Insights show the compact timer immediately above the tab bar (`.safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom)`). Its main area returns to Track; its Stop button saves in place and keeps the current destination selected. Track does not duplicate it.
- **Sign Out is owned by Profile**, not the Track toolbar. Tapping Sign Out shows a confirmation alert before clearing the local session, because local timer data may be lost. Sign Out must work offline by clearing the local session.
- The hierarchy maps to a future macOS sidebar without changing meaning (Track/History/Insights primary; profile-owned features secondary).

## Accessibility identifiers

- Every interactive element has a stable `accessibilityIdentifier`.
- Format: `<Screen><Element><Role>`. Examples: `EmailContinueButton`, `OtpFieldError`, `TimerStartButton`.
- Reuse identifiers across the app only when the element is truly the same.

## Undo flow (catalog deletions)

R3 / U6 / U7; decisions D17 + `unify-catalog-deletion`. Applies to entry and category deletions, all confirmed from their editing forms (entry form, category editor — no list swipes, no toasts).

- A deletion is **not** committed to the local store or pushed to sync immediately. It enters the client-side **durable undo buffer** and stays restorable until the app restarts; a cold launch commits whatever is still buffered.
- No `UndoToast` is shown. Undo is the DEFAULT system Undo confirmation only: shaking on the presenting surface shows the system prompt, and confirming restores exactly the most recent buffered deletion (registrations are cleared-then-single).
- The buffer is **superseded** by the next undoable action — only the most recent buffered deletion is restorable, including across surfaces (an entry delete followed by a category delete leaves only the category undoable, and vice versa; each surface filters snapshots by resource; older rows stay buffered until undone or the app restarts).
- On restart, commit locally (hard delete) and enqueue the `DELETE` for sync; the server hard-deletes (no trash, per `Activity_Catalog_API.md` Sync & ids).
- **Undo failure:** undo is a local transaction (no API call); on a local failure the surface keeps its last good snapshot and the buffer row is preserved for retry until the app restarts.

### Durable undo buffer (local-first)

D3 (OpenSpec change `local-first-sync-architecture`). The undo buffer is **durable** — it lives in an `undo_buffer` table in the local GRDB database, not in memory:

- There is no wall-clock undo window: a buffered deletion stays restorable until the app restarts. There is no countdown UI.
- A deletion writes the buffer row (full serialized snapshot of the deleted records) and removes the records in **one transaction**; no outbox row is created while the deletion is in the buffer, so the relay is never notified of an undone deletion.
- **A cold launch commits everything still buffered** — never while the process is alive, and there is no background timer. The commit deletes each buffer row + inserts the outbox rows in one transaction.
- The buffer **survives suspension and backgrounding**. After a restart, buffered deletions are finalized with no restore path.
- **Supersession (U7):** only the most recent buffered deletion is restorable via the system shake-to-undo; older rows stay buffered until undone or the app restarts.

### Shake-to-undo wiring (U7)

U7 says "no custom shake detection" — use the iOS system motion event. The view layer owns the binding:

- Every surface that can follow a deletion (Track, History, Manage Categories, entry form) hosts the shared passive `ShakeFirstResponderHost` (transparent, background-placed, holds first responder, handles NO motion itself) bound to its own `@Environment(\.undoManager)`.
- After a deletion lands, the surface registers the newest eligible buffer row cleared-then-single with `setActionName`, filtered by snapshot resource — so one shake+confirm restores at most one deletion, and foreign-surface rows are left for their owners.
- Do not implement custom accelerometer/gyro logic, and do not restore immediately on shake — the system prompt is the only confirmation.

### Plain-text capture (remove-activities-layer)

Track has one plain-text name field plus Recents chips. There is no search
sheet, no quick-create, and no catalog:

- **Draft vs. commit:** the field content is a temporary draft that never mutates committed history. Stopping the timer is the only commit boundary — it creates exactly one entry plus one outbox row.
- **Identity:** names are equal only as exact trimmed text (byte-exact, case-sensitive: `Gym` ≠ `GYM`). An exact match against a recent entry inherits that entry's full ordered category set at Start; otherwise the draft starts categoryless.
- **Running lock:** the name cannot be edited while running. The shared ordered tag selector stays live (select-only, zero allowed); toggles rewrite the draft snapshot only and never touch committed entries.
- **Validation:** Start is gated on trimmed non-empty text (≤ 60 chars); invalid input keeps Start disabled with localized guidance, never a blocking alert.

## Delete confirmation (F10 / U5)

Decision D18 (as superseded). The confirm pattern depends on what is being deleted.

- **Entry:** single destructive confirm naming the entry text → undo flow. There is no cascade and no scope choice.
- Destructive buttons use `role: .destructive` / `Theme.danger` tint.
- **Category:** single destructive confirm; the category's tag is removed from all entries (join cascade), entries themselves are unaffected — state this clearly in the confirm copy.

## Sync conflict (last-write-wins)

R2. Reuses the Offline sync path; do not duplicate the Offline section above.

- Every mutable request carries the client `updated_at`. The server applies the write only if `client.updated_at > server.updated_at`; otherwise it returns **409 `conflict`** with the server's current version in `details`.
- On 409 `conflict`, the client shows an inline `ErrorBanner` ("Edited on another device") and adopts the server's version as the source of truth (keep-latest). No field-level merge at MVP.
- If the user dismisses the conflict `ErrorBanner` without choosing, default to keep-latest (adopt server version) — the banner is informational, not blocking.
- On 409 `category_exists` (case-insensitive name collision on create), the client re-maps local references to the surviving id (see `Activity_Catalog_API.md` Sync & ids) and proceeds without an error.
- Idempotent `POST` (same id replayed) returns the existing record — the offline queue is safe to replay; do not surface this as an error.

### Confirmation-dialog cleanup

For destructive confirmations that use `.confirmationDialog` or `.alert`, the cancel callback attached to a `role: .cancel` button is **not** called when the user taps outside the sheet or swipes down. To avoid stale `pendingDelete` / "delete in progress" state, either:

- Observe the presentation binding (`isPresented`) in the parent ViewModel and clear pending state when it flips to `false`; or
- Provide an explicit `onDismiss` closure on the sheet/dialog and reset state there.

All manage-screen delete flows should follow this pattern consistently.

| Server response | Client action |
|---|---|
| 200/201 success | Apply locally, clear outbound queue entry |
| 404 not found (on DELETE) | Treat as success — item was already removed elsewhere; remove row locally, clear outbound queue entry |
| 409 `conflict` | `ErrorBanner`, adopt server version, keep-latest |
| 409 `category_exists` | Re-map local refs to surviving id, proceed |
| Idempotent POST (replay) | Treat as success; no error surfaced |

## Sync client (local-first)

D6 (OpenSpec change `local-first-sync-architecture`). Sync is an **optional transport feature**, not a prerequisite: the app works fully offline and unsigned; the `SyncController` activates only on sign-in and deactivates on sign-out.

- **Triggers:** (1) app enters foreground, (2) connectivity restored (`.satisfied`), (3) manual "Sync now" in Profile. No background task scheduling on iOS (unreliable); macOS may add a timer-based background sync later.
- **First-sync is pull-first:** on activation, pull the relay's full state, merge server-wins on `updated_at` conflicts, then drain the local outbox. Subsequent pulls are deltas via `?modified_since=` (per-resource cursor advanced to the max `updated_at` received).
- **Outbox drain:** one HTTP call per outbox row, in `created_at` order; idempotent POST / LWW PATCH / hard DELETE make replays safe. 409 `conflict` on push → adopt the server version (keep-latest) and clear the row; 409 `category_exists` → re-map local references to the winning id and proceed without an error.
- **Status display (Profile, visible only when signed in):** "Last synced: <relative time>" or "Syncing…" (button disabled while in progress) or an error state (button stays enabled to allow retry). The manual "Sync now" action calls the same drain+pull path as the automatic triggers.
- **Sign-out preserves local data and the outbox**; an explicit "Erase local data" action in Profile wipes them (destructive, confirmed).

## Category empty states

U8. Applies to Manage Categories and the Track Recents area.

- Show `EmptyState` (`COMPONENTS.md`) when there are zero categories (e.g. after deleting all, or if seeds are declined on first run).
- Empty states guide toward creation ("Add a category") and **never block** free-text timer start — typing a name and starting always works (F4 / D20).

## Recency ordering

Timer Recents are up-to-6 exact texts computed on-device from committed entries (`GROUP BY activity_text`, newest `started_at` wins per group). No manual drag-reorder at MVP. The Manage Categories list is name-ordered.

## Text and category semantics

- An entry owns the exact text being timed plus zero or more Categories in an explicit order; all three are written at creation and owned per entry.
- A Category is optional analytics metadata; the first-position category supplies chip/row icons.
- Track Recents and the running tag selector show exact texts and icons only. Category names are omitted from capture.
- Manage Categories is a separate surface. The entry form may assign or remove Categories for one entry.
- Editing one entry never reclassifies any other entry: history is immutable except through its own entry form.

## Editor sheets and keyboard placement

D13 / D21. Applies to `ActivityEditor` and `CategoryEditor`.

- Editors are presented as sheets (`.sheet`, medium detents) and shared across create + edit modes (D21).
- Inside the sheet, follow the existing **Keyboard and primary input placement** rule above:
  - The name field is in the upper scrollable area, focused on appear.
  - The Save `PrimaryButton` is pinned to `.safeAreaInset(edge: .bottom)` so it follows the keyboard and stays tappable.
  - A measured bottom reserve prevents the field from being hidden on short screens.
- Dismiss the sheet on save success or cancel; do not leave the keyboard up after save.
