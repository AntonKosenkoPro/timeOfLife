# App Shell Specification

## Purpose

Defines a stable product hierarchy for frequent capture, retrospective review, and analysis while keeping account and configuration tasks secondary and preserving access to a running timer.
## Requirements

### Requirement: Three primary destinations
The app SHALL provide Track, History, and Insights as its primary destinations, and SHALL identify Track as the destination for starting and controlling a timer. The History destination SHALL present committed time entries as a day-grouped, read-only list (see `history-entry-list` capability). The Insights destination SHALL present a period-scoped breakdown of committed tracked time with a hero total (see `insights-breakdown` capability), replacing the empty-state placeholder whenever committed entries exist. The History destination SHALL show the navigation bar (inline title and Profile button) at rest and collapse it on scroll; the Profile button remains present on Track and Insights. The app SHALL require authentication before presenting any primary destination: when the user is signed out, the app SHALL render the auth flow full-screen in place of the shell and MUST NOT render Track, History, Insights, or the tab bar; primary destinations become reachable only after sign-in. While a cached session restore is in flight and its outcome is still unknown, the app SHALL render a restoring splash (activity indicator, app identity) instead of the auth flow, so a restorable session never flashes the login screen. The shell SHALL mount only after the signed-in account's local store is bound, buffered deletions are committed, and starter categories are seeded; the first-sync network pull stays background and MUST NOT block the reveal.

#### Scenario: Local launch
- **WHEN** the user launches the app signed out, with no account or active timer
- **THEN** the auth flow is presented full-screen instead of Track and the primary destinations are not reachable until sign-in succeeds

#### Scenario: Switching destinations
- **WHEN** the user selects History or Insights
- **THEN** the selected destination becomes visible without changing timer state or discarding the state of the previous destination

#### Scenario: Profile access on History
- **WHEN** the user is on History at rest (list at top) and wants to open Profile
- **THEN** the Profile button is visible in the navigation bar and opens Profile

#### Scenario: Insights shows breakdown
- **WHEN** the user selects Insights with committed entries on record
- **THEN** the period breakdown with hero total is shown instead of the empty-state placeholder

#### Scenario: Auth gate is not a sheet
- **WHEN** the user is signed out at launch
- **THEN** the auth flow covers the full screen with no shell visible behind it, and there is no way to dismiss it into the app without signing in

#### Scenario: Restoring session shows splash, not login
- **WHEN** the app launches with a cached session and tokens whose server validation is still in flight
- **THEN** the gate renders a restoring splash instead of the auth flow, and the auth flow appears only if the restore resolves to signed-out

#### Scenario: Shell mounts after local ready
- **WHEN** the user signs in (fresh, restored, or re-login) on a device whose account file needs binding, buffered-deletion commit, or starter seeding
- **THEN** the shell appears only after the bind, commit, and seed complete, so the first Track paint already carries starter categories and never flashes an empty store

### Requirement: Profile owns secondary destinations
The app SHALL expose account, sync, category management, and destructive data controls from a profile destination rather than as a primary tab. The profile destination SHALL open as a pushed page on the current tab's own navigation path with the system back button, and SHALL NOT present as a sheet or offer a Done/dismiss control. Each tab (Track, History, Insights) SHALL own an independent navigation path: opening Profile on one tab SHALL NOT push Profile on any other tab, and switching tabs SHALL NOT carry Profile state across. Manage Categories SHALL keep pushing from Profile on the same tab path, and the category editor SHALL remain a sheet. The profile destination SHALL be signed-in-only: it SHALL NOT present an Enable Sync row or auth-flow sheet, and the auth flow SHALL NOT be presented from Profile as a sheet. Because the launch auth gate guarantees a signed-in user, the account and sync state shown in Profile SHALL reflect the active signed-in account at all times. The profile destination SHALL NOT expose integrations, export, appearance, or data-and-privacy placeholder rows, and no activity catalog exists. Destructive rows in Profile (Sign Out, Erase local data) SHALL share one list-row visual contract: the shared list row geometry with a leading icon and the danger tint.

#### Scenario: Open profile while signed out
- **WHEN** a user without an account attempts to reach the profile destination
- **THEN** the auth gate precedes it: the profile destination is unreachable, and the auth flow is the only presented surface until sign-in completes

#### Scenario: Return from profile
- **WHEN** the user navigates back from the profile destination
- **THEN** the previously selected primary destination and its own tab-path state are restored, and Track data is reloaded once on exit so categories created in Profile are immediately usable

#### Scenario: Profile stays on its tab
- **WHEN** the user opens Profile on Track and then switches to History (after navigating back)
- **THEN** History shows its own root — Profile is not pre-pushed there — and each tab's push state evolves independently afterwards

#### Scenario: Enable Sync with a restorable session
- **WHEN** the launch gate runs with a valid restorable session
- **THEN** the silent restore signs the user in with no auth flow shown and the shell is presented directly

#### Scenario: Enable Sync without a restorable session
- **WHEN** the launch gate runs with no restorable session
- **THEN** the required-voice auth flow is presented full-screen (never a silent no-op into the shell)

#### Scenario: Sign in from the sheet
- **WHEN** the user completes sign-in in the launch-gate auth flow
- **THEN** the shell replaces the auth flow with Track selected and Profile shows the signed-in account and sync state

#### Scenario: Dismiss the sheet unsigned
- **WHEN** the user attempts to leave the launch-gate auth flow without signing in
- **THEN** no dismiss or cancel path is offered: the gate remains full-screen and local data stays untouched

#### Scenario: No placeholder rows
- **WHEN** the user opens Profile
- **THEN** no Integrations, Export, Appearance, or Data & Privacy rows are shown, and every visible row is tappable or a live status

#### Scenario: Sign out row parity
- **WHEN** the user opens Profile
- **THEN** Sign Out renders with the same list-row geometry, leading icon, and danger tint as Erase local data, keeps the `ProfileSignOutButton` accessibility identifier, and tapping it signs the user out with no confirmation

### Requirement: Profile is a pushed page
The profile destination SHALL open as a pushed page on the current tab's navigation stack with the system back button, and SHALL NOT present as a sheet or offer a Done/dismiss control. Manage Categories SHALL keep pushing from Profile, and the category editor SHALL remain a sheet. Exiting Profile back to a tab SHALL restore the tab's prior state and reload Track data (recents + categories), so categories created in Profile are immediately usable.

#### Scenario: Open Profile from any tab
- **WHEN** the user taps the Profile button on Track, History, or Insights
- **THEN** Profile pushes onto that tab's navigation stack with a back button and no Done control

#### Scenario: Navigate back from Profile
- **WHEN** the user navigates back from Profile
- **THEN** the previously selected tab and its state are restored and Track data is reloaded

#### Scenario: Categories push unchanged
- **WHEN** the user opens Manage Categories from Profile
- **THEN** it pushes as before, and the category editor still opens as a sheet

### Requirement: Running timer remains globally accessible
The app SHALL keep an active timer visible and directly stoppable while History or Insights is selected. The compact timer SHALL float above the tab bar with a visible gap — never overlapping or touching it.

#### Scenario: Browse while timing
- **WHEN** a timer is running and the user switches from Track to History or Insights
- **THEN** a compact timer displays the entry text and live elapsed duration without obscuring primary navigation

#### Scenario: Stop outside Track
- **WHEN** the user activates Stop on the compact timer
- **THEN** the app saves the entry with the draft's final categories, removes the compact timer, and keeps the current destination selected

#### Scenario: Return to full timer
- **WHEN** the user activates the non-destructive area of the compact timer
- **THEN** the app selects Track and presents the running numeric timer

#### Scenario: Compact timer clears the tab bar
- **WHEN** a timer is running and the user views History or Insights
- **THEN** the compact timer renders fully above the tab bar with daylight between them on every supported screen size

#### Scenario: Track settles after an external stop
- **WHEN** the user returns to Track after stopping the timer from the compact timer
- **THEN** Track shows the settled post-stop state for the same text — never a running timer counting from the stopped start time
### Requirement: Navigation is accessible and stateful
Primary navigation and the compact timer SHALL expose stable accessibility labels, values, hints, and identifiers, and SHALL remain operable with VoiceOver and Dynamic Type.

#### Scenario: VoiceOver reads active timer
- **WHEN** VoiceOver focuses the compact timer
- **THEN** it announces the activity name, elapsed duration, running state, and available actions

#### Scenario: Large text
- **WHEN** the user selects an accessibility Dynamic Type size
- **THEN** navigation labels and compact timer content remain readable without hiding Start or Stop actions

### Requirement: Product hierarchy transfers to macOS
The product SHALL preserve Track, History, Insights, and profile-owned secondary destinations when represented in a macOS navigation container.

#### Scenario: macOS hierarchy
- **WHEN** the product hierarchy is implemented on macOS
- **THEN** Track, History, and Insights appear as primary sidebar destinations and profile-owned features remain secondary without changing their meaning

### Requirement: No global offline banner
The app SHALL NOT render a global offline banner on any tab. Offline state is surfaced only through the History pull-to-refresh offline notice (`HistoryPullModel` verdict → `PullNoticeBanner`) and the Profile sync-status row (`SyncController.status` error). The Track tab shows no offline hint.

#### Scenario: Offline on Track
- **WHEN** the user is signed in and offline on the Track tab
- **THEN** no banner or other global offline hint is shown and tracking keeps working fully offline

#### Scenario: Offline pull on History
- **WHEN** the user is signed in and offline and pulls to refresh the populated History list
- **THEN** the inline offline notice appears below the navigation bar (no sync cycle is burned) and auto-dismisses

#### Scenario: Offline status in Profile
- **WHEN** a sync cycle is skipped or fails for lack of connectivity
- **THEN** the Profile sync-status row shows the error state with its message until the next successful cycle

### Requirement: Auth gate copy is required voice
The auth flow presented at launch SHALL use required-voice copy that frames sign-in as the prerequisite for using the tracker (for example, "Log in to start tracking"), and MUST NOT use optional-sync voice framing the account as an optional cross-device feature.

#### Scenario: Welcome copy states the requirement
- **WHEN** the signed-out user sees the auth flow's welcome screen at launch
- **THEN** the copy states that logging in is required to start tracking, with no "Enable Sync" or "optional" framing

#### Scenario: Copy is localized
- **WHEN** the auth gate is rendered in each supported locale
- **THEN** the required-voice copy is provided for that locale alongside the English strings

### Requirement: Tab bar hidden on pushed destinations
The app SHALL hide the tab bar on every destination pushed past a tab root (Profile, Manage Categories, the pushed entry form, NamePicker), so a pushed page presents as a page with system Back and offers no tab-switch path while pushed. Returning via Back SHALL reveal the tab bar again on the originating tab root with its state intact, synchronously with the pop transition: the bar and the root content SHALL settle in a single coordinated layout pass with no post-settle relayout or content jump.

#### Scenario: Profile hides tabs
- **WHEN** the user opens Profile from any tab
- **THEN** the tab bar is hidden on Profile and no Track/History/Insights switch is reachable until Back

#### Scenario: Nested pushes keep tabs hidden
- **WHEN** the user navigates Profile → Manage Categories, History → entry form → NamePicker, or Track → NamePicker
- **THEN** the tab bar stays hidden at every depth and reappears only on return to the tab root

#### Scenario: No tab-switch-while-pushed
- **WHEN** a pushed destination is visible
- **THEN** there is no user-reachable path to change the selected tab without first navigating back

#### Scenario: Back reveals tab bar without relayout
- **WHEN** the user navigates back from any pushed destination to its originating tab root via the system Back button
- **THEN** the tab bar reappears as part of the pop transition and the root content holds its final layout with no second jump after the transition settles

#### Scenario: Cancelled swipe-back keeps tab bar hidden
- **WHEN** the user starts an interactive swipe-back from a pushed destination but releases without completing the pop
- **THEN** the pushed destination remains visible with the tab bar hidden and the originating tab root is unchanged

#### Scenario: Tab switch mid-push does not leak bar state
- **WHEN** a pushed destination is visible on one tab and the user returns to the tab bar path only via Back (no tab switch is reachable while pushed), then opens a destination on another tab
- **THEN** each tab's bar visibility follows only its own push depth: roots show the bar, pushed destinations hide it, independently per tab
